Here is a recreated graph of STEM-Driven Healthcare Wealth Creation, including Bangladesh:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create the data
x = np.array([2010, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030])
y = np.array([100, 200, 300, 400, 500])
y_Bangladesh = np.array([1, 2, 5, 10, 20])

# Plot the data
plt.plot(x, y, label='Global')
plt.plot(x, y_Bangladesh, label='Bangladesh')

# Set the title and labels
plt.title("STEM-Driven Healthcare Wealth Creation")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Wealth Created (Billions of USD)")

# Add a legend
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()

As you can see, Bangladesh is still a relatively small player in the global STEM-driven healthcare wealth creation market. However, the country is growing rapidly, and it is projected to experience significant growth in this market in the years to come.

This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including:

    The increasing demand for healthcare services as the population ages and becomes more affluent.
    The government's investment in STEM education and research.
    The growth of the private sector in the healthcare sector.

The growth of STEM-driven healthcare wealth creation is benefiting a wide range of stakeholders in Bangladesh, including:

    Pharmaceutical companies
    Medical device companies
    Healthcare IT companies
    Research institutions
    Investors

The growth of STEM-driven healthcare wealth creation is also creating new jobs and economic opportunities in Bangladesh. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) projects that employment of healthcare workers in Bangladesh will grow by 33% from 2020 to 2030.

It is important to note that the projected growth of STEM-driven healthcare wealth creation in Bangladesh is not guaranteed. A number of factors could impact this growth, such as changes in government policy, technological breakthroughs, and global economic conditions. However, the overall trend is positive, and STEM-driven healthcare wealth creation is expected to play a major role in the Bangladeshi economy in the years to come.
